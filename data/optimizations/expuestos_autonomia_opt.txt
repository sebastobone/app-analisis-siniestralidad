          estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
       2) We do an all-AMPs SUM step in TD_MAP1 to aggregate from

"     columns allowed), which is redistributed by the hash code of ("

"     result goes into Spool 12 (all_amps) (compressed columns allowed),"
     which is built locally on the AMPs.  Then we do a SORT to order
     Spool 12 by the hash code of (

     Spool 12 is estimated with low confidence to be 7 rows (175 bytes).
     The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.

     The estimated time for this step is 2 minutes and 14 seconds.

     estimated time for this step is 5.83 seconds.
" 44) Finally, we send out an END TRANSACTION step to all AMPs involved"
     in processing the request.
  -> The contents of Spool 4 are sent back to the user as the result of
     statement 1.  The total estimated time is 3 minutes and 57 seconds.
