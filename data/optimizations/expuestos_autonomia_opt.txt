Explanation
 This request is eligible for incremental planning and execution (IPE).
 The following is the static plan for the request.
"  1) First, we lock sura_consultas.POLIZA_CERTIFICADO_DD in TD_MAP1 for"
"     access, we lock Sura_Consultas.sucursal_dd in TD_MAP1 for access,"
"     we lock sura_consultas.ramo_dd in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock"
"     SURA_CONSULTAS.INSURANCE_COVERAGE_HIST in TD_MAP1 for access, we"
"     lock SURA_CONSULTAS.a in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock"
"     sura_consultas.underwriting_class in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock"
"     SURA_CONSULTAS.PRODUCT_GROUP in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock"
"     SURA_CONSULTAS.PRODUCT in TD_MAP1 for access, and we lock"
     SURA_CONSULTAS.PROD_GROUP_ASSOCIATION in TD_MAP1 for access.
"  2) Next, we do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from"
     Sura_Consultas.sucursal_dd by way of an all-rows scan with a
"     condition of (""NOT (Sura_Consultas.sucursal_dd.Sucursal_Id IS NULL)"")"
"     locking for access into Spool 12 (all_amps), which is duplicated"
     on all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 12 is estimated with
"     high confidence to be 640,768 rows (13,456,128 bytes).  The"
     estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
  3) We execute the following steps in parallel.
       1) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from
          sura_consultas.underwriting_class by way of an all-rows scan
"          with a condition of (""NOT (-3 IS NULL)"") into Spool 12"
"          (all_amps), which is duplicated on all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The"
          size of Spool 12 is estimated with high confidence to be
"          640,768 rows (13,456,128 bytes).  The estimated time for this"
          step is 0.01 seconds.
       2) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from

          locking for access into Spool 5 (all_amps) (compressed
"          columns allowed), which is duplicated on all AMPs in TD_Map1."
          Then we do a SORT to order Spool 5 by the hash code of (
          SURA_CONSULTAS.c.Product_Group_Id).  The size of Spool 5 is
"          estimated with high confidence to be 462,080 rows (7,855,360"
          bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
       3) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_MAP1 from SURA_CONSULTAS.a

          is joined to SURA_CONSULTAS.b by way of a RowHash match scan
          with no residual conditions locking SURA_CONSULTAS.a for

"     Aggregate intermediate results are computed globally, then placed"

     is built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 3 is estimated
