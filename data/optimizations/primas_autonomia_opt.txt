 This request is eligible for incremental planning and execution (IPE).
 The following is the static plan for the request.
"  1) First, we lock Sura_Consultas.sucursal_dd in TD_MAP1 for access,"

"     SURA_CONSULTAS.ULTIMO_DIA_MES in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock"
"     SURA_CONSULTAS.a in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock"
     SURA_CONSULTAS.GASTO_ADMINISTRATIVO_PROFIT_DD in TD_MAP1 for
"     access, we lock SURA_CONSULTAS.RT_NIVEL_INDICADOR_CINCO in TD_MAP1"
"     for access, we lock SURA_CONSULTAS.PRODUCT_GROUP_PROFIT_DD in"

"     lock SURA_CONSULTAS.PRODUCT in TD_MAP1 for access, and we lock"
     SURA_CONSULTAS.PROD_GROUP_ASSOCIATION in TD_MAP1 for access.
"  2) Next, we do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from"
     Sura_Consultas.sucursal_dd by way of an all-rows scan with no
"     residual conditions locking for access into Spool 4 (all_amps),"
     which is built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 4 is
"     estimated with high confidence to be 2,502 rows (440,352 bytes)."
     The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
  3) We execute the following steps in parallel.
       1) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from
          sura_consultas.underwriting_class by way of an all-rows scan
"          with no residual conditions into Spool 4 (all_amps), which is"
          built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 4 is estimated
"          with high confidence to be 2,503 rows (440,528 bytes).  The"
          estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
       2) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from

          Then we do a SORT to order Spool 11 by the hash code of (
          SURA_CONSULTAS.c.Product_Group_Id).  The size of Spool 11 is
"          estimated with high confidence to be 462,080 rows (7,855,360"
          bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
