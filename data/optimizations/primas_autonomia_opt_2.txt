"     we lock SURA_CONSULTAS.PRODUCT in TD_MAP1 for access, and we lock"
     SURA_CONSULTAS.PROD_GROUP_ASSOCIATION in TD_MAP1 for access.
"  2) Next, we do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from"
     Sura_Consultas.sucursal_dd by way of an all-rows scan with no
"     residual conditions locking for access into Spool 4 (all_amps),"
     which is built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 4 is
"     estimated with high confidence to be 2,502 rows (440,352 bytes)."
     The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
  3) We execute the following steps in parallel.
       1) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from
          sura_consultas.underwriting_class by way of an all-rows scan
"          with no residual conditions into Spool 4 (all_amps), which is"
          built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 4 is estimated
"          with high confidence to be 2,503 rows (440,528 bytes).  The"
          estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
       2) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from
          SURA_CONSULTAS.c by way of an all-rows scan with a condition

"          columns allowed), which is duplicated on all AMPs in TD_Map1."
          Then we do a SORT to order Spool 12 by the hash code of (
          SURA_CONSULTAS.c.Product_Group_Id).  The size of Spool 12 is
"          estimated with high confidence to be 462,080 rows (7,855,360"
          bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.

          with no residual conditions locking SURA_CONSULTAS.a for

"          (all_amps) (compressed columns allowed), which is built"
          locally on the AMPs.  Then we do a SORT to order Spool 13 by
          the hash code of (SURA_CONSULTAS.b.Product_Group_Id).  The
          size of Spool 13 is estimated with low confidence to be

"         CHARACTER SET LATIN, NOT CASESPECIFIC)) to all AMPs in TD_Map1."
         Then we do a SORT to order Spool 62 by row hash.  The size of
"         Spool 62 is estimated with no confidence to be 70 rows (9,380"
         bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
      2) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from SEBATOEC.p by
         way of an all-rows scan with no residual conditions into Spool
"         65 (all_amps) (compressed columns allowed), which is"
"         redistributed by the hash code of (SEBATOEC.p.compania_id,"
"         SEBATOEC.p.codigo_ramo_op, SEBATOEC.p.poliza_id) to all AMPs"
         in TD_Map1.  Then we do a SORT to order Spool 65 by row hash.
         The size of Spool 65 is estimated with high confidence to be
"         42 rows (3,906 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is"
         0.00 seconds.
 37) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 62 (Last Use) by
"     way of a RowHash match scan, which is joined to Spool 65 (Last"
     Use) by way of a RowHash match scan.  Spool 62 and Spool 65 are
"     left outer joined using a merge join, with condition(s) used for"
"     non-matching on left table (""(NOT (Compania_Id IS NULL )) AND (NOT"
"     (POLIZA_ID IS NULL ))""), with a join condition of (""(POLIZA_ID ="
     poliza_id) AND (((( CASE WHEN ((RAMO_ID = 78) AND (AMPARO_ID NOT

     (Codigo_Ramo_Op) END ))= codigo_ramo_op) AND (Compania_Id =
"     compania_id ))"").  The result goes into Spool 10 (all_amps)"
"     (compressed columns allowed), which is built locally on the AMPs."
     The size of Spool 10 is estimated with no confidence to be 70 rows
"     (11,340 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds."
 38) We do an all-AMPs SUM step in TD_Map1 to aggregate from Spool 10
"     (Last Use) by way of an all-rows scan, grouping by field1 ("
"     SEBATOEC.fechas.Mes_Id ,SURA_CONSULTAS.compania_dd.Codigo_Op ,("

     (TRANSLATE((SEBATOEC.p.apertura_canal_desc )USING
     LATIN_TO_UNICODE)) WHEN (NOT (SEBATOEC.c.apertura_canal_desc IS
     NULL )) THEN (TRANSLATE((SEBATOEC.c.apertura_canal_desc )USING
     LATIN_TO_UNICODE)) WHEN (NOT (SEBATOEC.s.apertura_canal_desc IS

     = 1) AND (VALOR_INDICADOR < 0.00000000000000E 000 )) THEN
     ('NEGATIVA') ELSE ('POSITIVA') END)).  Aggregate intermediate
"     results are computed globally, then placed in Spool 67 in TD_Map1."
     The size of Spool 67 is estimated with no confidence to be 62 rows
"     (23,932 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds."
 39) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_Map1 from Spool 67 (Last
"     Use) by way of an all-rows scan into Spool 5 (all_amps), which is"
     built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 5 is estimated with
"     no confidence to be 837,039 rows (118,859,538 bytes).  The"
     estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.
 40) We do an all-AMPs SUM step in TD_Map1 to aggregate from Spool 5
"     (Last Use) by way of an all-rows scan, grouping by field1 (MES_ID"
"     ,CODIGO_OP ,CODIGO_RAMO_AUX ,APERTURA_CANAL_AUX ,TIPO_PRODUCCION)."
"     Aggregate intermediate results are computed globally, then placed"
     in Spool 70 in TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 70 is estimated with no
"     confidence to be 836,977 rows (323,073,122 bytes).  The estimated"
     time for this step is 0.23 seconds.
 41) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_Map1 from Spool 70 (Last
     Use) by way of an all-rows scan into Spool 6 (used to materialize
"     view, derived table, table function or table operator base)"
"     (all_amps) (compressed columns allowed), which is built locally on"
     the AMPs.  The size of Spool 6 is estimated with no confidence to
"     be 836,977 rows (118,850,734 bytes).  The estimated time for this"
     step is 0.03 seconds.
 42) We do an all-AMPs STAT FUNCTION step in TD_Map1 from Spool 6 by
"     way of an all-rows scan into Spool 74, which is redistributed by"
     hash code to all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The result rows are put into
"     Spool 7 (group_amps), which is built locally on the AMPs.  This"
     step is used to retrieve the TOP 100 rows.  Load distribution
"     optimization is used. If this step retrieves less than 100 rows,"
     then execute step 43.  The size is estimated with no confidence to
"     be 100 rows (18,600 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is"
     0.03 seconds.
 43) We do an all-AMPs STAT FUNCTION step in TD_Map1 from Spool 6 (Last
"     Use) by way of an all-rows scan into Spool 74 (Last Use), which is"
     redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The result
"     rows are put into Spool 7 (group_amps), which is built locally on"
     the AMPs.  This step is used to retrieve the TOP 100 rows.  The
"     size is estimated with no confidence to be 100 rows (18,600 bytes)."
     The estimated time for this step is 0.03 seconds.
" 44) Finally, we send out an END TRANSACTION step to all AMPs involved"
     in processing the request.
  -> The contents of Spool 7 are sent back to the user as the result of
     statement 1.  The total estimated time is 5 minutes and 42 seconds.
